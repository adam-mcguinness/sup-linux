## Security Considerations

### Always Remember:
1. **Face authentication is NEVER the sole authentication method**
2. **Biometric data cannot be changed if compromised**
3. **Regular security audits are mandatory**
4. **User privacy must be protected**

### Enhanced Security Features:
1. **K-of-N Matching Strategy**
   - Require K successful face matches out of N consecutive attempts
   - Prevents single lucky match from granting access
   - Example: K=2, N=3 means 2 out of 3 attempts must succeed
   - Configurable per deployment or per user

2. **Adaptive Thresholds**
   - Base similarity threshold in config
   - Per-user threshold adjustments based on enrollment quality
   - Temporal threshold adjustments (stricter at night)
   - Environmental adjustments (IR illumination quality)

3. **Embedding Fusion and Quality Enhancement**
   - Enrollment improvements:
     - Store both individual and averaged embeddings
     - Quality metrics for each enrollment capture
     - Weighted averaging based on quality scores
   - Authentication improvements:
     - Rolling buffer of recent embeddings
     - Dynamic embedding fusion during auth
     - Compare against both stored individuals and average

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - INT8 model quantization for 2-4x speedup
   - Optimized image preprocessing pipeline
   - Persistent camera streaming session
   - ~16-20 FPS authentication capability

### Configuration Hierarchy:
1. System-wide: `/etc/linuxsup/config.toml`
2. User-specific: `~/.config/linuxsup/config.toml`
3. Development: `./dev_data/config.toml`

### Example Security Configuration:
```toml
[auth]
# Base similarity threshold
similarity_threshold = 0.6

# K-of-N matching
k_required_matches = 2      # Require 2 successful matches
n_total_attempts = 3        # Out of 3 total attempts

# Rolling buffer for embedding fusion
embedding_buffer_size = 3   # Keep last 3 embeddings for averaging
use_embedding_fusion = true # Enable dynamic embedding fusion

# Timeouts and limits
timeout_seconds = 5         # Total session timeout
lost_face_timeout = 3       # Timeout when face not detected
lockout_duration = 300      # 5 minute lockout after failure

# Enhanced security
require_blink_detection = true
min_face_size = 80         # Minimum face size in pixels
max_face_distance = 1.5    # Maximum distance factor from enrollment

[performance]
# Model optimization
enable_quantization = true  # Use INT8 quantization
optimization_level = 3      # ONNX optimization level

[enrollment]
# Enhanced enrollment
store_averaged_embedding = true
capture_quality_metrics = true
min_enrollment_quality = 0.7

[security]
# Anti-spoofing
require_ir_camera = true
check_image_quality = true
min_image_brightness = 30
max_image_brightness = 220

# Logging
log_failed_attempts = true
log_successful_auth = true
audit_file = "/var/log/linuxsup/audit.log"
```

## Testing Checklist

### Before Each Phase:
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Development Commands:
```bash
# Run in development mode
cargo run -- --dev test-camera

# Test face detection
cargo run -- --dev test-detection

# Enroll user (dev mode)
cargo run -- --dev enroll --username testuser

# Test authentication (dev mode)
cargo run -- --dev test --username testuser
```

## Success Criteria

## Development Notes for Next Session

### Current Status (Phase 1.9 MVP Complete)
- ✅ All Phase 1 features implemented and tested
- ✅ K-of-N authentication working successfully (tested by user)
- ✅ PAM integration complete with install/uninstall scripts
- ✅ System can handle both root and non-root user enrollment
- ✅ Performance optimized: ~50ms per detection, 16+ FPS

### Key Implementation Details
1. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - Uses rolling buffer with K-of-N matching
   - Compares against both individual and averaged embeddings
   - 5-second timeout with face loss detection

2. **Data Storage**:
   - System mode: `/var/lib/linuxsup/` (requires root)
   - User mode: `~/.local/share/linuxsup/` 
   - Development mode: `./dev_data/`
   - Authentication checks both system and user stores

3. **PAM Integration**:
   - **Current (MVP)**: Uses pam_exec with wrapper script
     - Binary: `linuxsup-auth` reads PAM_USER env var
     - Wrapper script: `linuxsup-pam-wrapper` sets up environment
     - Skips face auth for SSH/remote sessions
     - Example configs for sudo, GDM, SDDM included
   - **Target (Phase 3)**: Native PAM module with challenge-response
     - `pam_linuxsup.so` replaces pam_exec approach
     - Embedding service provides faces → embeddings only
     - PAM module handles all authentication decisions
     - Enhanced security through privilege separation

4. **Performance Notes**:
   - INT8 quantization enabled by default
   - Persistent camera streaming session implemented
   - Remove old 100ms sleep between attempts
   - Avoid creating/destroying V4L2 streams per frame

### Known Issues Fixed
- ✅ Serialization issue with UserData (removed skip_serializing_if)
- ✅ Channel mismatch (YOLOv8 needs 3ch, ArcFace needs 1ch)
- ✅ Performance bottlenecks resolved

### Next Steps (Phase 3: Secure PAM Integration)
- Replace pam_exec wrapper with native Rust PAM module
- Implement challenge-response protocol for security
- Separate embedding service from authentication logic
- Move all security decisions to PAM module
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

```bash
# Install system-wide (requires root)
sudo ./install.sh

# Test enrollment (as regular user)
linuxsup enroll --username $USER

# Test authentication
linuxsup test --username $USER

# Test with sudo (after PAM setup)
sudo -k  # Clear sudo cache
sudo ls  # Should trigger face auth

# Uninstall
